                  <h2>About</h2> 
                    <p>My name is Isabella and I am an undergraduate student studying Experience Architecture with a minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I am also an aspiring UX designer!  

                      Growing up, I have always had a love for art and creativity. I was constantly drawing and painting, and building things.  As I grew older, my intended path was to become an Architect but once I learned about UX Design I knew that was what I was meant to do. I decided to combine my love for design and technology by pursuing a career in UX design and majoring in Experience Architecture at Michigan State University. 
                      
                      What I love most about UX design is the ability to solve complex problems and create solutions that impact our society in a positive sense. I enjoy creating products that will solve an issue no matter how small or large it is, and I find it incredibly rewarding to see users interact with and enjoy the products I've designed. 
                      
                      In my free time, I love to stay active by doing yoga, walking, playing sports with my friends, or relaxing and reading a book. I find that creating my own art pieces helps me mentally and also inspires my work as a UX designer.
